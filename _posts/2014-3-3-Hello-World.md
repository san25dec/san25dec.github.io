Hello! I am Santhosh, and I am currently in my 5th year of Electrical Engineering Dual Degree (BTech+MTech integrated) at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. My academic interests include Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Signal Processing. I love reading novels, and some of my favourite authors include Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle and Robert Harris. I also like listening to music, and I am learning Western Classical music on keyboard as a hobby. Pleased to meet you!
