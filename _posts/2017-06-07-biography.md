I am passionate about the fields of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I am
also interested in Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing and
Computational Photography. I will be joining as a graduate student in the 
[Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/) at The  University of Texas at Austin in fall 2017.
 
I completed my Dual Degree (BTech + MTech integrated) in the [Electrical
 Engineering Department](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/), IIT Madras in 2017. The topic
of my masters thesis was **An Empirical Evaluation of Visual Question 
Answering for Novel Objects** where I was advised by [Prof. Gaurav Sharma](http://www.grvsharma.com/research.html) and [Prof. Anurag Mittal](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~amittal/).

My extra curricular interests include playing the keyboard (western
 classical), listening to music, reading novels and swimming. During my
time at IIT Madras, I had the opportunity to work as a volunteer for
[SPIC MACAY](http://spicmacay.com/) and was fortunate to be a part of the
organizing team for the [$$2^{nd}$$ International Convention](http://spicmacay.com/intcon/2014) held at IIT Madras.
