## [Model Based Representations for Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/san25dec/san25dec.github.io/blob/master/_files/ModelBasedRepresentationsRL.pdf)
(*Reinforcement Learning course project*), *January 2017 - May 2017*

Representations learnt in Deep Q-Networks are based on the Q-learning
objective which uses rewards obtained from the environment. This form of
representation learning may not be generalizable across tasks. We learn
model-based representations, i.e, representations which aid in predicting
the future states given the current state and actions. We shown that such
representations are more generalizable across tasks than reward-based
representations. 


## [Neural Machine Translation](https://github.com/san25dec/san25dec.github.io/blob/master/_files/NeuralMachineTranslation.pdf)
(*Speech Signal Processing course project*), *August 2016 - November 2016*

Implemented seq2seq based Neural Machine Translation model to translate from
Hindi to English in torch7 and evaluated on HindEnCorpus-0.5. 

## [Spell Checker](https://github.com/san25dec/san25dec.github.io/blob/master/_files/SpellChecker.pdf)
(*NLP course project*), *July 2015 - November 2015*

Implemented a word, phrase and sentence spell checking systems using
statistical models such as the Noisy Channel model for word spell check and
Bayesian Classifier using context and collocation features for phrase and
sentence spell check.

## [Statistical Machine Translation](https://github.com/san25dec/san25dec.github.io/blob/master/_files/StatisticalMachineTranslation.pdf) 
(*NLP course project*), *July 2015 - November 2015*

Developed a statistical machine translation system based on IBM Models 1 and
2 to translate French sentences to English. A greedy approach was used to
improve the sentence generation algorithm.

## [Salient Object Detection](https://github.com/san25dec/san25dec.github.io/blob/master/_files/SaliencyTPAReport.pdf)
(*Computer Vision course project*) *January 2015 - May 2015*

Improved the multiscale detection algorithm in Discriminative Regional
Feature Integration approach for saliency detection. Segmented the salient
objects using the saliency map as a prior to the grabcut algorithm. 

## [Trifocal Tensor Estimation](https://github.com/san25dec/san25dec.github.io/blob/master/_files/TrifocalTensorEstimation.pdf)
(*Geometry and Photometry course project*) *January 2015 - May 2015*

Implemented a robust algorithm to estimate the trifocal tensor with
6 point correspondences using the trilinearity equations.
